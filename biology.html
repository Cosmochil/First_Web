          Because the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate except
          when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate nasal breather. Rabbits
          have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other. This way they
          can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often
          confused.[6] Carl Linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and rodents
          under the class Glires; later, they were separated as the scientific
          consensus is that many of their similarities were a result of
          convergent evolution. However, recent DNA analysis and the discovery
          of a common ancestor has supported the view that they do share a
          common lineage, and thus rabbits and rodents are now often referred to
          together as members of the superorder Glires.[7]

        <p>
          Since speed and agility are a rabbit's main defenses against predators
          (including the swift fox), rabbits have large hind leg bones and well
          developed musculature. Though plantigrade at rest, rabbits are on
          their toes while running, assuming a more digitigrade form. Rabbits
          use their strong claws for digging and (along with their teeth) for
          defense.[8] Each front foot has four toes plus a dewclaw. Each hind
          foot has four toes (but no dewclaw)
        </p>
        <p>
          Most wild rabbits (especially compared to hares) have relatively full,
          egg-shaped bodies. The soft coat of the wild rabbit is agouti in
          coloration (or, rarely, melanistic), which aids in camouflage. The
          tail of the rabbit (with the exception of the cottontail species) is
          dark on top and white below. Cottontails have white on the top of
          their tails
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result of the position of the eyes in its skull, the rabbit has a
          field of vision that encompasses nearly 360 degrees, with just a small
          blind spot at the bridge of the nose.

          <h3>Hind Limb Element</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          The anatomy of rabbits' hind limbs are structurally similar to that of
          other land mammals and contribute to their specialized form of
          locomotion. The bones of the hind limbs consist of long bones (the
          femur, tibia, fibula, and phalanges) as well as short bones (the
          tarsals). These bones are created through endochondral ossification
          during development. Like most land mammals, the round head of the
          femur articulates with the acetabulum of the ox coxae. The femur
          articulates with the tibia, but not the fibula, which is fused to the
          tibia. The tibia and fibula articulate with the tarsals of the pes,
          commonly called the foot. The hind limbs of the rabbit are longer than
          the front limbs. This allows them to produce their hopping form of
          locomotion. Longer hind limbs are more capable of producing faster
          speeds. Hares, which have longer legs than cottontail rabbits, are
          able to move considerably faster.[12] Rabbits stay just on their toes
          when moving this is called Digitigrade locomotion. The hind feet have
          four long toes that allow for this and are webbed to prevent them from
          spreading when hopping.[13] Rabbits do not have paw pads on their feet
          like most other animals that use digitigrade locomotion. Instead, they
          have coarse compressed hair that offers protection.[14]

        <h4>Musculatur</h4>
        <p>
          Rabbits have muscled hind legs that allow for maximum force,
          maneuverability, and acceleration that is divided into three main
          parts; foot, thigh, and leg. The hind limbs of a rabbit are an
          exaggerated feature, that are much longer than the forelimbs providing
          more force. Rabbits run on their toes to gain the optimal stride
          during locomotion. The force put out by the hind limbs is contributed
          to both the structural anatomy of the fusion tibia and fibula, and
          muscular features.[15] Bone formation and removal, from a cellular
          standpoint, is directly correlated to hind limb muscles. Action
          pressure from muscles creates force that is then distributed through
          the skeletal structures. Rabbits that generate less force, putting
          less stress on bones are more prone to osteoporosis due to bone
          rarefaction.[16] In rabbits, the more fibers in a muscle, the more
          resistant to fatigue. For example, hares have a greater resistance to
          fatigue than cottontails. The muscles of rabbit's hind limbs can be
          classified into four main categories: hamstrings, quadriceps,
          dorsiflexors, or plantar flexors. The quadriceps muscles are in charge
          of force production when jumping. Complementing these muscles are the
          hamstrings which aid in short bursts of action. These muscles play off
          of one another in the same way as the plantar flexors and doriflexors,
          contributing to the generation and actions associated with force.

          <h3>Ears</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Within the order lagomorphs, the ears are utilized to detect and avoid
          predators. In the family Leporidae, the ears are typically longer than
          they are wide. For example, in black tailed jack rabbits, their long
          ears cover a greater surface area relative to their body size that
          allow them to detect predators from far away. Contrasted to cotton
          tailed rabbits, their ears are smaller and shorter, requiring
          predators to be closer to detect them before they can flee. Evolution
          has favored rabbits having shorter ears so the larger surface area
          does not cause them to lose heat in more temperate regions. The
          opposite can be seen in rabbits that live in hotter climates, mainly
          because they possess longer ears that have a larger surface area that
          help with dispersion of heat as well as the theory that sound does not
          travel well in more arid air, opposed to cooler air. Therefore, longer
          ears are meant to aid the organism in detecting predators sooner
          rather than later in warmer temperatures.[18] The rabbit is
          characterized by its shorter ears while hares are characterized by
          their longer ears.[19] Rabbits' ears are an important structure to aid
          thermoregulation and detect predators due to how the outer, middle,
          and inner ear muscles coordinate with one another. The ear muscles
          also aid in maintaining balance and movement when fleeing predators.

        <h4>Outer Ear</h4>
        <p>
          The auricle, also known as the pinna, is a rabbit's outer ear.[21] The
          rabbit's pinnae represent a fair part of the body surface area. It is
          theorized that the ears aid in dispersion of heat at temperatures
          above 30 Â°C with rabbits in warmer climates having longer pinnae due
          to this. Another theory is that the ears function as shock absorbers
          that could aid and stabilize rabbit's vision when fleeing predators,
          but this has typically only been seen in hares.[22] The rest of the
          outer ear has bent canals that lead to the eardrum or tympanic
          membrane.
        </p>
        <h4>Middle Ear</h4>
        <p>
          The middle ear is filled with three bones called ossicles and is
          separated by the outer eardrum in the back of the rabbit's skull. The
          three ossicles are called hammer, anvil, and stirrup and act to
          decrease sound before it hits the inner ear. In general, the ossicles
          act as a barrier to the inner ear for sound energy.
        </p>
        <h4>Inner Ear</h4>
        <p>
          Inner ear fluid called endolymph receives the sound energy. After
          receiving the energy, later within the inner ear there are two parts:
          the cochlea that utilizes sound waves from the ossicles and the
          vestibular apparatus that manages the rabbit's position in regards to
          movement. Within the cochlea there is a basilar membrane that contains
          sensory hair structures utilized to send nerve signals to the brain so
          it can recognize different sound frequencies. Within the vestibular
          apparatus the rabbit possesses three semicircular canals to help
          detect angular motion.

          <h3>Thermolegulation</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Thermoregulation is the process that an organism utilizes to maintain
          an optimal body temperature independent of external conditions.[24]
          This process is carried out by the pinnae which takes up most of the
          rabbit's body surface and contain a vascular network and arteriovenous
          shunts.[25] In a rabbit, the optimal body temperature is around
          38.5â40â.[26] If their body temperature exceeds or does not meet this
          optimal temperature, the rabbit must return to homeostasis.
          Homeostasis of body temperature is maintained by the use of their
          large, highly vascularized ears that are able to change the amount of
          blood flow that passes through the ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Constriction and dilation of blood vessels in the ears are used to
          control the core body temperature of a rabbit. If the core temperature
          exceeds its optimal temperature greatly, blood flow is constricted to
          limit the amount of blood going through the vessels. With this
          constriction, there is only a limited amount of blood that is passing
          through the ears where ambient heat would be able to heat the blood
          that is flowing through the ears and therefore, increasing the body
          temperature. Constriction is also used when the ambient temperature is
          much lower than that of the rabbit's core body temperature. When the
          ears are constricted it again limits blood flow through the ears to
          conserve the optimal body temperature of the rabbit. If the ambient
          temperature is either 15 degrees above or below the optimal body
          temperature, the blood vessels will dilate. With the blood vessels
          being enlarged, the blood is able to pass through the large surface
          area which causes it to either heat or cool down.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the summer, the rabbit has the capability to stretch its pinnae
          which allows for greater surface area and increase heat dissipation.
          In the winter, the rabbit does the opposite and folds its ears in
          order to decrease its surface area to the ambient air which would
          decrease their body temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The jackrabbit has the largest ears within the Oryctolagus cuniculus
          group. Their ears contribute to 17% of their total body surface area.
          Their large pinna were evolved to maintain homeostasis while in the
          extreme temperatures of the desert.

          <h3>Respitory System</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          The rabbit's nasal cavity lies dorsal to the oral cavity, and the two
          compartments are separated by the hard and soft palate.[27] The nasal
          cavity itself is separated into a left and right side by a cartilage
          barrier, and it is covered in fine hairs that trap dust before it can
          enter the respiratory tract.[28][27] As the rabbit breathes, air flows
          in through the nostrils along the alar folds. From there, the air
          moves into the nasal cavity, also known as the nasopharynx, down
          through the trachea, through the larynx, and into the lungs.[28][29]
          The larynx functions as the rabbit's voice box, which enables it to
          produce a wide variety of sounds.[28] The trachea is a long tube
          embedded with cartilaginous rings that prevent the tube from
          collapsing as air moves in and out of the lungs. The trachea then
          splits into a left and right bronchus, which meet the lungs at a
          structure called the hilum. From there, the bronchi split into
          progressively more narrow and numerous branches. The bronchi branch
          into bronchioles, into respiratory bronchioles, and ultimately
          terminate at the alveolar ducts. The branching that is typically found
          in rabbit lungs is a clear example of monopodial branching, in which
          smaller branches divide out laterally from a larger central branch.[
        </p>
        <p>
          Rabbits breathe primarily through their noses due to the fact that the
          epiglottis is fixed to the backmost portion of the soft palate.[29]
          Within the oral cavity, a layer of tissue sits over the opening of the
          glottis, which blocks airflow from the oral cavity to the trachea.[27]
          The epiglottis functions to prevent the rabbit from aspirating on its
          food. Further, the presence of a soft and hard palate allow the rabbit
          to breathe through its nose while it feeds.[2
        </p>
        <p>
          Rabbits lungs are divided into four lobes: the cranial, middle,
          caudal, and accessory lobes. The right lung is made up of all four
          lobes, while the left lung only has two: the cranial and caudal
          lobes.[30] In order to provide space for the heart, the left cranial
          lobe of the lungs is significantly smaller than that of the right.[27]
          The diaphragm is a muscular structure that lies caudal to the lungs
          and contracts to facilitate respiration.

          <h3>Digestion</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Rabbits are herbivores that feed by grazing on grass, forbs, and leafy
          weeds. In consequence, their diet contains large amounts of cellulose,
          which is hard to digest. Rabbits solve this problem via a form of
          hindgut fermentation. They pass two distinct types of feces: hard
          droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are
          known as caecotrophs or "night droppings" [31] and are immediately
          eaten (a behaviour known as coprophagy). Rabbits reingest their own
          droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do cows and numerous other
          herbivores) to digest their food further and extract sufficient
          nutrients.[32]
        </p>
        <p>
          Rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a
          grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half
          an hour of more selective feeding.[citation needed] In this time, the
          rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets
          that will not be reingested.[citation needed] If the environment is
          relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many
          hours, grazing at intervals.[citation needed] While out of the burrow,
          the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested
          pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as
          they are produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hard pellets are made up of hay-like fragments of plant cuticle and
          stalk, being the final waste product after redigestion of soft
          pellets. These are only released outside the burrow and are not
          reingested. Soft pellets are usually produced several hours after
          grazing, after the hard pellets have all been excreted.[citation
          needed] They are made up of micro-organisms and undigested plant cell
          walls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rabbits are hindgut digesters. This means that most of their digestion
          takes place in their large intestine and cecum. In rabbits, the cecum
          is about 10 times bigger than the stomach and it along with the large
          intestine makes up roughly 40% of the rabbit's digestive tract.[33]
          The unique musculature of the cecum allows the intestinal tract of the
          rabbit to separate fibrous material from more digestible material; the
          fibrous material is passed as feces, while the more nutritious
          material is encased in a mucous lining as a cecotrope. Cecotropes,
          sometimes called "night feces", are high in minerals, vitamins and
          proteins that are necessary to the rabbit's health. Rabbits eat these
          to meet their nutritional requirements; the mucous coating allows the
          nutrients to pass through the acidic stomach for digestion in the
          intestines. This process allows rabbits to extract the necessary
          nutrients from their food.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chewed plant material collects in the large cecum, a secondary
          chamber between the large and small intestine containing large
          quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of
          cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins. The pellets are about
          56% bacteria by dry weight, largely accounting for the pellets being
          24.4% protein on average. The soft feces form here and contain up to
          five times the vitamins of hard feces. After being excreted, they are
          eaten whole by the rabbit and redigested in a special part of the
          stomach. The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach;
          the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. This
          double-digestion process enables rabbits to use nutrients that they
          may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as
          the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and thus ensures that
          maximum nutrition is derived from the food they eat.[10] This process
          serves the same purpose in the rabbit as rumination does in cattle and
          sheep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rabbits are incapable of vomiting.[36] Because rabbits cannot vomit,
          if buildup occurs within the intestines (due often to a diet with
          insufficient fiber[37]), intestinal blockage can occur.[38]

        </header>
        <p>The adult male reproductive system forms the same as most mammals with the seminiferous tubular compartment containing the Sertoli cells and an adluminal compartment that contains the Leydig cells.[39] The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which maintains libido[39] and creates secondary sex characteristics such as the genital tubercle and penis. The Sertoli cells triggers the production of Anti-MÃ¼llerian duct hormone, which absorbs the MÃ¼llerian duct. In an adult male rabbit, the sheath of the penis is cylinder-like and can be extruded as early as two months of age.[40] The scrotal sacs lay lateral to the penis and contain epididymal fat pads which protect the testes. Between 10 and 14 weeks, the testes descend and are able to retract into the pelvic cavity in order to thermoregulate.[40] Furthermore, the secondary sex characteristics, such as the testes, are complex and secrete many compounds. These compounds includes fructose, citric acid, minerals, and a uniquely high amount of catalase.[39]</p>
        <p>The adult female reproductive tract is bipartite, which prevents an embryo from translocating between uteri.[41] The two uterine horns communicate to two cervixes and forms one vaginal canal. Along with being bipartite, the female rabbit does not go through an estrus cycle, which causes mating induced ovulation.[4</p>
        <p>The average female rabbit becomes sexually mature at 3 to 8 months of age and can conceive at any time of the year for the duration of her life. However, egg and sperm production can begin to decline after three years.[39] During mating, the male rabbit will mount the female rabbit from behind and insert his penis into the female and make rapid pelvic hip thrusts. The encounter lasts only 20â40 seconds and after, the male will throw himself backwards off the female.[</p>
        <p>The rabbit gestation period is short and ranges from 28 to 36 days with an average period of 31 days. A longer gestation period will generally yield a smaller litter while shorter gestation periods will give birth to a larger litter. The size of a single litter can range from four to 12 kits allowing a female to deliver up to 60 new kits a year. After birth, the female can become pregnant again as early as the next day.[40]</p>
        <p>The mortality rates of embryos are high in rabbits and can be due to infection, trauma, poor nutrition and environmental stress so a high fertility rate is necessary to counter this.[40]</p>

        <p>Rabbits may appear to be crepuscular, but their natural inclination is toward nocturnal activity.[43] In 2011, the average sleep time of a rabbit in captivity was calculated at 8.4 hours per day.[44] As with other prey animals, rabbits often sleep with their eyes open, so that sudden movements will awaken the rabbit to respond to potential danger.[45]</p>

        <p>In addition to being at risk of disease from common pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Escherichia coli, rabbits can contract the virulent, species-specific viruses RHD ("rabbit hemorrhagic disease", a form of calicivirus)[46] or myxomatosis. Among the parasites that infect rabbits are tapeworms (such as Taenia serialis), external parasites (including fleas and mites), coccidia species, and Toxoplasma gondii.[47][48] Domesticated rabbits with a diet lacking in high fiber sources, such as hay and grass, are susceptible to potentially lethal gastrointestinal stasis.[49] Rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies to humans.[50]</p>
        <p>Encephalitozoon cuniculi, an obligate intracellular parasite is also capable of infecting many mammals including rabbits.</p>
