        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        <strong>Rabbits</strong> are small mammals in the family
        <em>Leporidae</em> of the order <em>Lagomorpha</em> (along with the hare
        and the pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit
        species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds of domestic rabbit.
        Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types
        of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every
        continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild
        prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its
        widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or
        <strong>bunny</strong>) is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily
        lifeâ€”as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic
        inspiration.

          <h2>Terminology</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Male rabbits are called bucks; females are called does. An older term
          for an adult rabbit is coney (derived ultimately from the Latin
          cuniculus), while rabbit once referred only to the young animals.
          Another term for a young rabbit is bunny, though this term is often
          applied informally (particularly by children) to rabbits generally,
          especially domestic ones. More recently, the term kit or kitten has
          been used to refer to a young rabbit. A group of rabbits is known as a
          colony or nest (or, occasionally, a warren, though this more commonly
          refers to where the rabbits live). A group of baby rabbits produced
          from a single mating is referred to as a litter, and a group of
          domestic rabbits living together is sometimes called a herd

          <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order
          <em>Rodentia</em> (rodent) until 1912, when they were moved into a new
          order, <em>Lagomorpha</em>
          (which also includes pikas). Below are some of the genera and species
          of the rabbit.

          <h3>Difference from Hare</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Hares are <em>precocial</em>, born relatively mature and mobile with
          hair and good vision, while rabbits are <em>altricial</em>, born
          hairless and blind, and requiring closer care. Hares (and cottontail
          rabbits) live a relatively solitary life in a simple nest above the
          ground, while most rabbits live in social groups in burrows or
          warrens. Hares are generally larger than rabbits, with ears that are
          more elongated, and with hind legs that are larger and longer. Hares
          have not been domesticated, while descendants of the European rabbit
          are commonly bred as livestock and kept as pets.

          <h3>Domestication</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          abbits have long been domesticated. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the
          European rabbit has been widely kept as livestock, starting in ancient
          Rome. Selective breeding has generated a wide variety of rabbit
          breeds, of which many (since the early 19th century) are also kept as
          pets. Some strains of rabbit have been bred specifically as research
          subjects. As livestock, rabbits are bred for their meat and fur. The
          earliest breeds were important sources of meat, and so became larger
          than wild rabbits, but domestic rabbits in modern times range in size
          from dwarf to giant. Rabbit fur, prized for its softness, can be found
          in a broad range of coat colors and patterns, as well as lengths. The
          Angora rabbit breed, for example, was developed for its long, silky
          fur, which is often hand-spun into yarn. Other domestic rabbit breeds
          have been developed primarily for the commercial fur trade, including
          the Rex, which has a short plush coat.
