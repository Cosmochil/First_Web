          Rabbits are prey animals and are therefore constantly aware of their
          surroundings. For instance, in Mediterranean Europe, rabbits are the
          main prey of red foxes, badgers, and Iberian lynxes.[51] If confronted
          by a potential threat, a rabbit may freeze and observe then warn
          others in the warren with powerful thumps on the ground. Rabbits have
          a remarkably wide field of vision, and a good deal of it is devoted to
          overhead scanning.[52] They survive predation by burrowing, hopping
          away in a zig-zag motion, and, if captured, delivering powerful kicks
          with their hind legs. Their strong teeth allow them to eat and to bite
          in order to escape a struggle.[53] The longest-lived rabbit on record,
          a domesticated European rabbit living in Tasmania, died at age 18.[54]
          The lifespan of wild rabbits is much shorter; the average longevity of
          an eastern cottontail, for instance, is less than one year.

        <h2>Habitat and Range</h2>
        <p>
          Rabbit habitats include meadows, woods, forests, grasslands, deserts
          and wetlands.[56] Rabbits live in groups, and the best known species,
          the European rabbit, lives in burrows, or rabbit holes. A group of
          burrows is called a warren.[56]
        </p>
        <p>
          More than half the world's rabbit population resides in North
          America.[56] They are also native to southwestern Europe, Southeast
          Asia, Sumatra, some islands of Japan, and in parts of Africa and South
          America. They are not naturally found in most of Eurasia, where a
          number of species of hares are present. Rabbits first entered South
          America relatively recently, as part of the Great American
          Interchange. Much of the continent has just one species of rabbit, the
          tapeti, while most of South America's southern cone is without
          rabbits.

        <h2>Environmental Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Rabbits have been a source of environmental problems when introduced
          into the wild by humans. As a result of their appetites, and the rate
          at which they breed, feral rabbit depredation can be problematic for
          agriculture. Gassing, barriers (fences), shooting, snaring, and
          ferreting have been used to control rabbit populations, but the most
          effective measures are diseases such as myxomatosis (myxo or mixi,
          colloquially) and calicivirus. In Europe, where rabbits are farmed on
          a large scale, they are protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus
          with a genetically modified virus. The virus was developed in Spain,
          and is beneficial to rabbit farmers. If it were to make its way into
          wild populations in areas such as Australia, it could create a
          population boom, as those diseases are the most serious threats to
          rabbit survival. Rabbits in Australia and New Zealand are considered
          to be such a pest that land owners are legally obliged to control
          them.[60][61]
